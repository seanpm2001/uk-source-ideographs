# UK-Source Ideographs

*UK-Source Ideographs* documents the source references for the CJK Unified Ideographs that are submitted by the UK (*United Kingdom*) to the [IRG](http://appsrv.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~irg/) (*Ideographic Research Group*) for inclusion in their working sets by providing the actual submissions. Such ideographs are referred to as UK-source ideographs, which is documented in Unicode Standard Annex #38 ([UAX #38](https://unicode.org/reports/tr38/)), *Unicode Han Database (Unihan)*, as the [*kIRG_UKSource*](https://unicode.org/reports/tr38/#kIRG_UKSource) property.

* [IRG N2107R2](https://github.com/unicode-org/uk-source-ideographs/raw/main/IRGN2107R2.pdf) (PDF), which was originally submitted as IRG N2107 for [IRG #45](http://appsrv.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~irg/irg/irg45/IRG45.htm), documents the 1,640 UK-source ideographs that were submitted for IRG Working Set 2015, 1,566 of which are encoded in [CJK Unified Ideographs Extension G](https://www.unicode.org/Public/13.0.0/charts/blocks/U30000.pdf) ([Unicode Version 13.0](https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode13.0.0/)). The per-ideograph attributes can be found in an Excel file that is a PDF attachment. For purely legacy reasons, these 1,640 UK-source ideographs, along with 16 that were withdrawn in the first revision of IRG N2107, can also be found in Unicode Standard Annex #45 ([UAX #45](https://unicode.org/reports/tr45/)), *U-Source Ideographs*, as source references UK-01313 through UK-02968.

* [IRG N2232R](https://github.com/unicode-org/uk-source-ideographs/raw/main/IRGN2232R.pdf) (PDF), which was originally submitted as IRG N2232 for [IRG #49](http://appsrv.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~irg/irg/irg49/IRG49.htm), documents the 1,000 UK-source ideographs that were submitted for IRG Working Set 2017, 917 of which are encoded in [CJK Unified Ideographs Extension H](https://unicode.org/charts/PDF/U31350.pdf) ([Unicode Version 15.0](https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode15.0.0/)). The per-ideograph attributes can be found in an Excel file that is a PDF attachment.

Evidence images for both IRG N2107R2 and IRG N2232R are easily downloaded from the [Latest Release](https://github.com/unicode-org/uk-source-ideographs/releases/latest/) as *UKSourceEvidence.pdf*, which is a 1,236-page bookmarked PDF.

The glyphs that correspond to the UK-source ideographs are available in TrueType (TTF) format, their use is covered under the terms of the [Arphic Public License](https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/non-gnu/chinese-fonts-truetype/LICENSE) (also see *LICENSE.md*), and can be easily downloaded from the [Latest Release](https://github.com/unicode-org/uk-source-ideographs/releases/latest/). For *IRGN2232.ttf*, the glyphs are mapped from PUA (*Private Use Area*) code points as specified in the Excel file that is attached to *IRGN2232R.pdf*.

The table below indicates the number of UK-Source ideographs that have been encoded in CJK Unified Ideographs **Extension** blocks as horizontal extensions and as of [Unicode Version 15.0](https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode15.0.0/):

**Extension** | **Ideographs**
--- | ---
[A](https://unicode.org/charts/PDF/U3400.pdf) | 3
[B](https://unicode.org/charts/PDF/U20000.pdf) | 12
[C](https://unicode.org/charts/PDF/U2A700.pdf) | 1
[E](https://unicode.org/charts/PDF/U2B820.pdf) | 2
[F](https://unicode.org/charts/PDF/U2CEB0.pdf) | 2

UK submissions to future IRG working sets will be added to this repository as appropriate.
